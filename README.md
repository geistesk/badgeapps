# Badge Applications

Some applications written for the [SHA2017][sha17] badge and the
[card10][cccamp19] badge from the Chaos Communication Camp 2019.


## alarm, *card10* [hatchery][hatchery-alarm]

A simple countdown-like alarm, which reminds you to check the long rinse queue
again or the like.


## fractal_tree, *card10, sha2017* [hatchery][hatchery-fractal_tree]

Draws multiple fractal trees. Quite useless btw.

This application was written for the SHA2017 badge and was ported to the
CCCamp's card10. It should run on both badges and perhaps also on this
Hacker Hotel 2019-thingy.


## matrix, *card10* [hatchery][hatchery-matrix]

Display a Matrix-like animation with a configurable overlay (none, nickname,
time) and optionally blinking LEDs.

The overlay can be switched by the bottom buttons and the LEDs can be
enabled/disabled by the top right button.


## pixelflood, *sha2017* [hatchery][hatchery-pixelflood]

Pixelflood server on your badge.


## sensorthingy, *card10* [hatchery][hatchery-sensorthingy]

The SensorThingy interacts with the card10's sensors and logs them into a
JSON file.
